# lavaplayer-natives-rust

Attempt to port the [lavaplayer natives](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer/tree/master/natives/connector) to pure Rust implementations to simplify the building for different platforms.

## Current progress

The project has all function signatures ported over and lacks implementations.
